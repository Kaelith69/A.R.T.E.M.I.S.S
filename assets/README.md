# Demo Assets

Place the demo GIF here: `assets/demo.gif`

The GIF should show:
- A user sending an image to a Telegram group
- A.R.T.E.M.I.S.S. deleting the NSFW message instantly
- The bot sending a violation warning in the group
- The admin dashboard updating in real-time

Keep it under 5MB. Record your terminal or screen-capture a live session.

The README references this file at `assets/demo.gif`.
